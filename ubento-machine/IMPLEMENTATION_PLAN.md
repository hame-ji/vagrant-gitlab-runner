## 1. Testing & CI/CD Integration
- Add Molecule testing: Init in `provisioning/` (`molecule init scenario --driver-name docker`); test playbook with `molecule test` for idempotence across Ubuntu versions, including lint checks.
- Lint & syntax check: Integrate `ansible-lint` (targeting zero warnings post-fixes) and `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` into a Makefile or Vagrantfile hook.
- CI/CD: Suggest GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ansible.yml`) to run lint/tests on PRs; push to repo for version control if not already.

## 2. Deployment & Verification
- Backup originals: Copy files before edits.
- Apply changes: Run `vagrant destroy && vagrant up` to provision; verify repos with `apt-cache policy docker-ce`; re-run `ansible-lint` to confirm errors resolved.
- Iterate: If issues, use `ansible-playbook -vvv` for debug; update CRUSH.md with new commands (e.g., lint/test scripts) after user approval.
- Timeline: 1-2 hours for core refactor including lint fixes; 4-6 for full testing/roles.

This plan ensures scalability (e.g., multi-env support), security, and maintainability while minimizing disruption and addressing all identified ansible-lint errors.
